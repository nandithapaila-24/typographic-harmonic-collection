        <h1 id="notosans">A New York Day</h1>

        <p id="zalando">Today, I walked to Central Park. I biked around and fed the pigeons. I sat on a bench and read a book I have been trying to finish for ages. I saw the cutest dog wearing a jacket and shoes. The fall leaves are turning various shades of red, orange and green. There was a slight, autumn chill in the air. It was a good day.</p>

        <p class="questions">How did this passage feel? Did it feel romantic? Did it feel dull? Did it feel intimate? Did it feel impersonal?</p>

        <p class="question-2">Now make the desktop window smaller!</p>
